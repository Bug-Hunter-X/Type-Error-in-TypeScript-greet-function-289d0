This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The `greet` function takes a string and a Date object as arguments. However, the `console.log` statement attempts to print the Date object as a string, which is not allowed in TypeScript. This will result in a type error.  The solution shows how to correctly handle the Date object by using the `toDateString()` method to convert it to a string before printing it.
